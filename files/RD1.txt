For the first article, about the standardization of industry tools in graphic design, I believe the author poses their look at the possession of the tools of designers and how so many of us are blind to the tools we use nowadays, particularly by design of the companies that own them. They create a standard that they uphold by locking developers and curious designers out of the code, of the process, of the workings of the software. The second article goes into a different, yet parallel topic, regarding code, and the nature of the copyright vs open source, and how the ideals of open source may have gotten a bit twisted along the way, resulting in open source often being eaten up and used for profit by companies, whether large or small. The issue on code is a bit different from the issues with software, as I perceived it as being the issue of privately owned software being kept out of the hands of the users, and the issue with open source code, made by and for the users, being used and sometimes ideologically twisted by the companies who 'poached' them.

Aside from the use of softwares, I believe the skill I find most integral in graphic design is creativity and the ability to convey the message of the client, or whomever the client may be.
